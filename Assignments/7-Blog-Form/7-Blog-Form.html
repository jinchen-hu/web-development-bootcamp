		Each year, since 2007, Mayday -- who have just celebrated their 20th anniversary -- have played a series of shows in Hong Kong in May, adding more and more shows each year, hoping to take over the whole month. This year, the band's Hong Kong dates are followed by shows in mainland China in July and August, Malaysia in October, North America -- including dates in San Jose, New York and Toronto -- in November and Singapore in December.

		In recent years, their Hong Kong dates have become famed as marathons of music, with each show typically lasting upwards of three and a half hours with multiple encores, costume changes and lasers. This year, between songs, they broadcasted mini-movies, caricaturing each band member as a superhero fighting a monster. 
	</p>
	<p>
		During most of the songs, fans stood up, frantically waving blue wands. The night before the last show, Taiwanese actor Richie Jen and Hong Kong singer Edmond Leung were in the audience and joined Mayday onstage.

		Mayday primarily sings in Mandarin and Taiwanese, with some English sprinkled in. Songs are catchy and addictive, happy-go-lucky, pop-infused anthemic rock, akin to U2 or One Direction, And with titles like "Party Animal," "Cheers" and "Here, After Us," they project the innocence of a younger generation, with all its accompanying hope and heartbreak. Other artists from Taiwan have encountered difficulties in China for being outspoken about the island, which China regards as a breakaway province, but Mayday has largely steered clear of politics. Ashin says the group wants their music to be at the forefront.
